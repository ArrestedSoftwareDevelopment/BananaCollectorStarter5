# BananaCollectorStarter5
Demo

An out-growth of me working through some tutorials at https://www.raywenderlich.com/771-unreal-engine-4-tutorial-for-beginners-getting-started. It all started because this guy used a banana object. Then I found a 3D-printed Mr. Banana Grabber object by Justin Wilcott (https://www.thingiverse.com/jwilcott/designs), and put it back together (poorly) in Lightwave 3D. Ideally, people who are better with Unreal Engine will pick this project up. 

I'm just working on the basic mechanics right now. The real fun, I feel, will come in the level design. 

Planned updates include:

MAKE THE DAMN CHARACTER FACE IN THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
Add the Bluth sign to the banana stand.
Rebuild the Mr. Banana Grabber mesh to include his ears, and rotating wheels on the segway.
Rebuild the player's pawn as a character. (I made a huge mistake.)
Intro splash screen.
More samples from the show.
Theme music.
Jump function.
Obstacles that make you lose bananas.
Camera follows player.
Integrate the stair car. (And hop-ons!)

Planned level ideas:

Tutorial/introductory level. (Which is what this is.)
There's Always Money in the Banana Stand. (Money falls from the sky to be collected.)
Flamer. (Prevent the stand from being burned down).
I Blue Myself. (?)
The Final Countdown. (?)
Balboa Island map.
Model Home map.

Ultimately:

Multi-player.
Tobias, etc. as playable characters.
